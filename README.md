[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/unipayment/client.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/unipayment/client)

A PHP SDK for the [UniPayment Client API](https://unipayment.readme.io/reference/overview).

This SDK provides a convenient abstraction of UniPayment's Gateway API and allows developers to focus on payment
flow/e-commerce integration rather than on the specific details of client-server interaction using the raw API.

## Getting Started

[Integration Tutorial](https://bit.ly/up-help-integration)

Before using the UniPayment API, sign up for your [API key](https://console.unipayment.io/).

If you want to use the Sandbox, sign up [here](https://sandbox-console.unipayment.io/).

## Installation

### Install Composer

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

### Install via composer

Add unipayment/client into require section of composer.json

```json
{
  "require": {
    "unipayment/client": "2.*"
  }
}

```

## Initializing UniPayment SDK

```php
$configuration = new \UniPayment\SDK\Configuration();
$configuration->setClientId('your client id');
$configuration->setClientSecret('your secret key');
$configuration->setAppId('your app id');
$configuration->setIsSandbox(false);
```

Sandbox is used in the same way with is_sandbox as true.

```php
$configuration = new \UniPayment\SDK\Configuration();
$configuration->setClientId('your client id');
$configuration->setClientSecret('your secret key');
$configuration->setAppId('your app id');
$configuration->setIsSandbox(true);
$configuration->setDebug(true);        
```


## Create an invoice

> Referenceï¼šhttps://unipayment.readme.io/reference/create_invoice

```php
$createInvoiceRequest = new \UniPayment\SDK\Model\CreateInvoiceRequest();
$createInvoiceRequest->setAppId($configuration->getAppId());
$createInvoiceRequest->setOrderId(Uuid::uuid4());
$createInvoiceRequest->setPriceAmount(1.0);
$createInvoiceRequest->setPriceCurrency('USD');
$createInvoiceRequest->setLang("en");
$createInvoiceRequest->setExtArgs("Merchant Pass Through Data");

$billingAPI  = new \UniPayment\SDK\BillingAPI($configuration);
try{
    $createInvoiceResponse = $billingAPI->createInvoice($createInvoiceRequest);
} catch (\UniPayment\SDK\UnipaymentSDKException $e) {
   ...
}
```

### CreateInvoiceResponse

## Webhook Signature Verification

Use the below code to verify of the 'hmac_signature' which can extract from the request header

```php

use UniPayment\SDK\Utils\WebhookSignatureUtil;

//Use raw json payload (no formatting or pretty print)
$payload = 'json payload';
$secretKey = 'your secret key';
$signature = 'signature to verify';
$valid = WebhookSignatureUtil::isValid($payload, $secretKey, $signature);

```
